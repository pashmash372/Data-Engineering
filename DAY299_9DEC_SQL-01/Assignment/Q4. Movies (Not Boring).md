Problem Statement:

Write a query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
Sample Input:

Table: cinema



Sample Output:



Explanation:

We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5.
The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.


Complete Solution
SELECT *
FROM cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1
AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
Note: Here % can also be used inplace of mod function.
