Approach 1:

STEP 1: Select all the columns from the table movies.

STEP 2:Use the order by clause and order the column revenue in descending order to get the highest to lowest revenue.

STEP 3: Use the limit and offset to display the third-highest revenue movie details.
So, offset 2 skips the first two values, and limit 1 displays the third value which is the third-highest revenue.
